In this immersion, daily challenges were proposed using Java.

Day 01

We built an application from scratch to consume the IMDb API and display the most popular movies, highlighting their posters and viewing their rating.

Put the IMDB API key somewhere outside the code like a configuration file (eg a .properties file).

Day 02

Creating a sticker generator exploring other Java native libraries, so that we can send our favorite movies by Whatsapp.

Day 03

A refactoring of the code was made, applying the concepts of P.O.O. and created new classes, where we left the code cleaner and more organized.
